# PharmaSight Web App v2

This is the redesigned version of the PharmaSight web application.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main dashboard page with sidebar navigation
- `styles.css` - Modern CSS styling with a clean design system
- `script.js` - JavaScript for sidebar interactions and UI behavior

## Features

### Sidebar Navigation
The sidebar includes the following navigation items (matching the original app):
- Dashboard
- Daily Summary
- Monthly Summary
- Stock Management
- Stock Queries
- Debtor Tools
- Daily Tracking
- Targets
- Admin (in footer)

### Design Highlights
- Modern, clean interface with a dark sidebar
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Professional color scheme with blue accents
- User info section in sidebar footer
- Mobile-friendly hamburger menu

## Current Status

**Note:** Navigation items are currently visual only. Functionality will be added in future iterations.

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the dashboard. The sidebar navigation items will update the page title when clicked, but no actual navigation or data loading occurs yet.

## Next Steps

- Add routing/navigation functionality
- Integrate with backend API
- Build out individual page components
- Add data visualization components
- Implement authentication
